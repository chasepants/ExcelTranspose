Qualtrics Survey Data transposed for ReCal 0.1 Alpha

Qualtics survey's excel sheet is not formatted for reliability tests. This program takes in a .csv file and transposes it so that a
ReCal 0.1 Alpha reliability test can use it. 


Work that needs to be done. 

I want to make this program so that it can take in parameters and transpose as the user wants. Currently it only works for my one test case.
